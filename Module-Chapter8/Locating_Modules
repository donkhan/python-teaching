When you import a module, the Python interpreter searches for the module in the following sequences âˆ’

The current directory.
If the module isn't found, Python then searches each directory in the shell variable PYTHONPATH.
If all else fails, Python checks the default path. On UNIX, this default path is normally /usr/local/lib/python/.

The module search path is stored in the system module sys as the sys.path variable. The sys.path variable contains the current directory, PYTHONPATH, and the installation-dependent default.
